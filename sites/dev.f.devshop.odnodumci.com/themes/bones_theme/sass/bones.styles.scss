// Import variables, abstractions, base styles and components using globbing.
//
// Globbing will always import files alphabetically. Optimally, all your
// components should be self-contained and explicit enough to not have any
// contained styles leak into unrelated components: The import order should not
// affect the result.
//
// If there are variables, functions or mixins that depend on each other and
// therefore need to be imported in a specific order you can import them
// directly. Variables-, function- or mixin providing partials should never
// output any styles themselves: Importing them multiple times to resolve
// dependencies shouldn't be a problem.
