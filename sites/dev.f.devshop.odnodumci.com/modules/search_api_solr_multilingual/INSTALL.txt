Setting up Solr
---------------

In order for this module to work, you will first need to set up a Solr server.
See search_api_solr/INSTALL.txt for the basics.

But don't install any drupal configs or schemas right now!

search_api_solr_multilingual adds some more restrictions and requires a
different (but easier) kind of configuration.

search_api_solr_multilingual requires at least solr 4.5.x.


Installing search_api_solr_multilingual and configuring Drupal
--------------------------------------------------------------

While search_api_solr itself only supports the "classic schema mode",
search_api_solr_multilingual adds (experimental) support for the "managed
schema mode".

No matter which mode you choose, the order of the installation process changes
with search_api_solr_multilingual:

1. Install the search_api_solr_multilingual module (and its module
   dependencies).

2. Install the module's composer dependencies, there are multiple ways to do
   this; you can read more in the documentation[1] on drupal.org.

3. Create a Search API Server according to the search_api documentation using
   "Multilingual Solr" or "Multilingual Solr Managed Schema" as Backend.

4. Download the config.zip from the server's details page and deploy it on your
   Solr server. Therefor you have to follow the instructions in
   search_api_solr/INSTALL.txt but use the files extracted from the downloaded
   config.zip instead of the ones from the search_api_solr/solr-conf/ folder.

NOTE: If you use the "Multilingual Solr" backend you have to repeat step 4
every time you add a new language to your Drupal instance.

NOTE: It's important that the Solr server runs with the right config files for
a backend. Don't switch between the Solr Backend and the Solr Multilingual
Backend without adjusting the config files!

For configuring indexes and searches you have to follow the documention of
search_api.
