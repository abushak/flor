## INTRODUCTION

If you want to have a separate Add to cart button for each product variation,
then this module is for you. Beside showing buttons for each variation, there
are additional settings, like option to display price, currency and quantity. 
You can also choose which product attributes to show in your add to cart form.

On the permissions page 'admin/people/permissions' you can control who can use 
Add to cart button. Search for the 'Access variation add to cart' permission.

To use this module you must have Drupal Commerce 2.x installed. This module was
created for one of our projects, and it is still in the development phase, just
like Drupal Commerce 2.x, so if you find bugs or if you want to suggest a
feature please open an issue.
